			<h2> A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application. </h2>
			<h2> Moreover, a patent is a right to use an invention. If one creates a product — their product — their right is to exclude others from using, making, and selling the product. If one creates a new method of using a product, then their right is to exclude others from using that product. A patent protects an invention by allowing its inventor — or the group who owns the patent — control over who may use the invention. </h2>
